This a spam detection model written using python.

## I used NLTK for tokenising, lematizing and also use feature extraction for better accuraacy..

## There are two notebook, one using machine learning for prediction while other using deep learning.

For machine learning I used :
 -- Naive Baiyes 
 -- Support Vector Machine
 -- Random Forest
 -- K-Nearest Neighbours

 For Deep learning I used : 
 -- Simple Neural Network
 -- LSTM
 -- Bi-Directional RNN
